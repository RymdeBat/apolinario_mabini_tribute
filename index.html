     "The Spaniards underestimated Mabini primarily because he was a cripple. Had they known of his intellectual perspicacity,
     they would have killed him earlier. The Americans did not. They were aware of his superior intelligence, his tenacity
     when he faced them in negotiations for autonomy and ceasefire."
